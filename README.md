# Challenge1
Kickstarter Analysis

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
In this project, I analyzed kickstarter campaign data to study different elements of campaigns. The purpose of this analysis was to learn how launch date and financial goals impacted the success of fundraiser campaigns. My client, Louise, was particularly interested in the theater/plays category/subcategory. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I started the analysis by reviewing the relationship between theater campaign outcomes and the month in which they launched. I started by adding column to the table and using the YEARS() function to return the year of the campaign based on the mm/dd/yyyy structure. Next, I created a pivot table to organize the campaign outcomes by month and added a filter so my client could look specifically at Theater campaigns.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
